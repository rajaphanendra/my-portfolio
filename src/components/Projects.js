        interface built with Django, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, with attendance recorded in real-time. RFID-based Attendance: Arduino IDE and ESP8266 are used to 
        read RFID tags, sending data via HTTP to the Django backend for processing and storage in the MySQL database.Face Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV and 
        Face_Recognition libraries to capture and match user faces, recording attendance automatically without physical contact.This multi-method approach 
        provides flexibility, ensuring accurate attendance tracking with minimal manual effort.`,
